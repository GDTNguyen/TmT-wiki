**TestMyThumbnails.com** offers three core features—**Test**, **Create**, and **Research**—designed to empower YouTube creators to optimize their video thumbnails and titles for maximum engagement and performance.

## Test

Perform A/B testing on your thumbnails with ease. Upload two or more thumbnail options for a single video, and our tool will present each version to different audience segments. It tracks key metrics such as click-through rate (CTR) and watch time share to identify which thumbnail drives the most clicks and viewer engagement. This data-driven testing helps you confidently select the most effective thumbnail.

## Create

Generate professional-quality thumbnails instantly using our AI-powered thumbnail generator. Simply provide a text description of your desired thumbnail, and the tool will produce multiple high-quality options within seconds. This feature streamlines the creative process and eliminates the need for advanced design skills, allowing you to craft eye-catching thumbnails quickly.

## Research

Leverage AI-driven insights and resources to enhance your thumbnails and titles. By analyzing millions of existing thumbnails, our Research feature offers actionable recommendations—such as adjusting focal points, adding text overlays, or enhancing colors—to boost visual appeal and CTR. Stay ahead of trends and make informed design decisions with this powerful tool.
